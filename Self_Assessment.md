# Self Assessment
## Roles
Initially, I took on the square role, setting up the Github repository and creating each team member's repository.  I voluntarily took on this initial role because I wanted to become better acquainted with Github and it's features.
I also attempted to help with the Maching Learning models but ran in to difficulties.  
While working on the presentation development, I learned quite a bit about the git pages in Github and enjoyed using it.

## Personal Challenge
My greatest challenge was not necessarily with the classwork or time spent on it, but with personal events that came up during some of the more complex or difficult challenges.  In order to overcome these, I simply spent extra time outside class reviewing and re-reviewing recorded classes, and researching on various sites such as Stack Overflow.  I also attended several office hours before class times and on weekends.  I reached out to the tutors as well for assistance.

# Team Assessment
## Communication Protocol
The team was able to perform nearly all activity during class time as well as office hours with only one evening meeting outside of class time. All other communications were done in Slack and Github.
## Strengths
Each person had their own strengths they brought to this project and each person's strengths were used efficiently.  
We did well with assigning roles and responsibilities, while also challenging each other to think outside the box.  

# Summary

The project analyzes sleep data collected from Sleep Cycle iOS App on Kaggle in order to determine what contributes to good sleep. Factors examined are caffeine consumption, physical activity, heart rate, and length of time sleeping. We used Linear Regression Model to train our data so we could measure the quality of a person's sleep based on these factors. While our initial Classifier model utilizing the emojis in the original dataset resulted in a higher accuracy score, the Linear Regression model was deemed to be more effective in measuring sleep quality because we were expanding what the results could be; going from just 3 options to 100.
